<h1>Water aerobics </h1>
<p>is the performance of aerobic exercise in water such as in a swimming pool.<br> It is done mostly vertically and without swimming typically in waist deep or deeper water.<br>
 Water aerobics is a form of aerobic exercise that requires water-immersed participants.<br> Most water aerobics is in a group fitness class setting with a trained professional teaching for about an hour.<br>
  The classes focus on aerobic endurance, resistance training, and creating an enjoyable atmosphere with music.<br> Different forms of water aerobics include: aqua Zumba, water yoga, aqua aerobics, and aqua jog.<br>
<br>
While similar to land aerobics, in that it focuses on cardiac training,<br> water aerobics differs in that it adds the component of water resistance and buoyancy. <br>
Although heart rate does not increase as much as in land-based aerobics, the heart is working just as hard,<br> and underwater exercise actually pumps more blood to the heart.<br>
Exercising in the water is not only aerobic, but also strength-training oriented due to the water resistance.<br>Moving your body through the water creates a resistance that will activate muscle groups.<br>
 Hydro aerobics is a form of an aerobic exercise that requires water-immersed participants.

<h1>Bodybuilding</h1>
<p>
    Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's muscles (muscle building) by muscle hypertrophy for aesthetic purposes.<br>
    It is distinct from similar activities such as powerlifting because it focuses on physical appearance instead of strength.<br>
     An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder.<br>
    In professional bodybuilding, competitors appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank them based on symmetry, muscularity, size, conditioning, posing, and stage presentation.<br>
     Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through the elimination of nonessential body fat, enhanced at the last stage by a combination of extracellular dehydration and carbo-loading, to achieve maximum muscular definition and vascularity; <br>
     they also tan and shave to accentuate the contrast of their skin under the spotlights.<br>
    A bodybuilder performs the incline dumbbell press.
    Bodybuilding takes a great amount of effort and time to reach the desired results. A bodybuilder might first be able to gain 8–20 pounds (4–9 kg) of muscle per year, if lifting for seven hours on a weekly basis. However, gains begin to slow down after the first two years to about 5-15 pounds (2-7 kg). After five years, gains can decrease to just 3-10 pounds (1-5 kg).</p>
